Project Title: Connect to a PostgreSQL database and try to connect to Redis or Kafka

Project Description:

This project is to create a Go application that can connect to a PostgreSQL database and try to connect to Redis or Kafka. The application should be able to perform basic CRUD operations on the PostgreSQL database. The application should also be able to publish and subscribe to messages on Redis or Kafka.

Requirements:

The application must be written in Go.
The application must be able to connect to a PostgreSQL database.
The application must be able to try to connect to Redis or Kafka.
The application must be able to perform basic CRUD operations on the PostgreSQL database.
The application must be able to publish and subscribe to messages on Redis or Kafka.
Additional Notes:

The application should be designed to be scalable and reliable.
The application should be well-documented.
The application should be tested.
This project is estimated to take 3-4 days to complete, but I would give the candidate 1 week time to allow for any unexpected delays.

Here are some additional features that the candidate could implement to make the project more challenging and to demonstrate their skills:

Add support for multiple databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB).
Add support for multiple caching providers (e.g., Redis and Memcached).
Add support for multiple messaging providers (e.g., Redis, Kafka, and RabbitMQ).
Add support for load balancing and failover.
Add support for authentication and authorization.
Add support for monitoring and logging.
