Certainly! Here's a defined project for a mid to senior-level Go engineer that involves connecting to a PostgreSQL database and optionally exploring connections to Redis or Kafka. The project should be designed to be completed within 3-4 days, but you can give the candidate up to a week to allow for a reasonable amount of time for thorough implementation and potential extra features.

Project Name: Go Database Connector
Project Description:
Create a Go application that connects to a PostgreSQL database, fetches data, and provides the option to explore connecting to Redis or Kafka for additional functionality. This project aims to demonstrate your proficiency in Go, database connectivity, and optionally working with message brokers.

Project Requirements:
PostgreSQL Database Connection:

Implement a connection to a PostgreSQL database.
Create a simple Go program that fetches data from the database. For example, you could fetch and display records from a "users" table.
Redis Integration (Optional):

If time permits, add Redis integration to the project.
Implement features such as caching data in Redis, fetching data from Redis cache, and updating the cache when the database is modified.
Kafka Integration (Optional):

If time permits and you want to demonstrate expertise with message brokers, explore connecting to Kafka.
Implement a basic producer-consumer model using the Kafka messaging system.
Tasks and Timeline:
Day 1-2: Database Connectivity (2 days)

Set up a PostgreSQL database or use an existing one for testing.
Implement a Go program to establish a connection to the database.
Create functions for querying and fetching data from the database.
Day 3: Redis Integration (Optional)

If you choose to include Redis integration, set up a Redis instance or use an existing one.
Implement functions to cache data in Redis and retrieve it.
Day 4: Kafka Integration (Optional)

If you choose to include Kafka, set up a Kafka instance or use an existing one.
Implement a simple producer and consumer for Kafka.
Day 5-7: Testing, Documentation, and Extra Features

Test the entire application to ensure it works correctly.
Create documentation, including a README with instructions for setup and usage.
Implement any "Better to Do This Also" or "Extra Features" you'd like to include, as mentioned in the previous template.
Evaluation Criteria:
Successful database connection and data retrieval.
Optional Redis and/or Kafka integration if chosen.
Clean and well-structured Go code.
Error handling and best practices.
Thorough testing.
Clear and concise documentation.
This project allows the candidate to demonstrate their proficiency in Go, working with databases, and optionally working with Redis and Kafka. It also leaves room for them to showcase their skills by adding extra features or improvements as they see fit.
